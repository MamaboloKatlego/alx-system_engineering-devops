Post-Mortem: The Great Load Balancer Blunder

When Technology Throws a Curveball

Issue Summary:

Duration: April 6th, 2024, 13:00 UTC - April 7th, 2024, 01:00 UTC
Impact: Our web platform experienced intermittent connectivity issues, causing frustration for users and a 20% increase in error rates.
Root Cause: A load balancer, feeling a bit too 'balanced', decided to play favorites, causing uneven traffic distribution and backend server overload.
Timeline:

April 6th, 2024, 13:30 UTC: Our monitoring system started buzzing like an angry bee, signaling increased error rates.
April 6th, 2024, 13:35 UTC: Engineers sprang into action, donning their detective hats and diving into backend server health and network connectivity.
April 6th, 2024, 14:00 UTC: The hunt led us down the rabbit hole of a potential database bottleneck. Turns out, the database was innocent.
April 6th, 2024, 15:30 UTC: Database team cleared their name, shifting focus to the load balancer, suspecting it of foul play.
April 6th, 2024, 16:45 UTC: In a plot twist, we ventured into the labyrinth of application codebase, searching for the elusive bug.
April 6th, 2024, 18:00 UTC: With frustration mounting, we called in the cavalry – senior engineering management – for backup.
April 6th, 2024, 20:00 UTC: The truth came to light! The load balancer had been playing favorites, causing mayhem in traffic distribution.
April 7th, 2024, 01:00 UTC: Victory! Load balancer configurations were adjusted, restoring balance to the force.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The load balancer, in a moment of misguided generosity, had been unfairly favoring certain backend servers. This led to an imbalance in traffic distribution, causing some servers to buckle under pressure.

To right this wrong, engineers adjusted the load balancer configurations to spread the love evenly among all backend servers. Peace was restored, and servers rejoiced in their newfound workload harmony.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Regular load balancer configuration audits to catch any mischievous settings.
Beef up monitoring systems to keep a closer eye on traffic distribution and server health.
Establish clear procedures for incident escalation – because sometimes, you just need to call in the big guns.
Tasks:

Conduct a thorough load balancer configuration review, rooting out any bias.
Implement automated checks to ensure load balancer settings stay on the straight and narrow.
Document load balancer best practices, because knowledge is power (and prevention).
Remember, even in the darkest of tech mysteries, there's always a solution – and maybe a few laughs along the way!
